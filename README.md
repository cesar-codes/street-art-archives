# Why I Built This
This is a personal project inspired by the tiger mural that used to be on the side of my old apartment building in downtown San Francisco. 
The building owners eventually decided to paint over it, and a huge, beautiful piece of art was lost forever. 
This project is an attempt to digitally preserve street art and graffitti.
It is a full stack application with authentication where users can add their own street art images, location and description. 
It can be used by fans to share their favorite pieces, and also by the artists themselves to showcase and advertise their work.
